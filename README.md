# Resume-Analyzer-Pro
A Django-based web app that extracts and compares technical and soft skills from job descriptions and resumes using a T5 transformer model. Helps users analyze skill gaps and job-role fit effectively.

**# Job Skill Extractor**
Job Skill Extractor is a web application that simplifies the process of analyzing job descriptions and resumes by automatically extracting technical and soft skills using Natural Language Processing (NLP). Built with Django and powered by the T5 Transformer model, the system helps job seekers and recruiters bridge the skill gap between candidate profiles and job requirements.

Users can register/login, upload a job description or resume, and the app will identify and display the relevant technical skills and soft skills separately. Additionally, it compares the skills from both inputs to determine the level of match, helping users identify areas of improvement. The system provides a clean, interactive interface and allows for easy skill extraction and analysis.

Key features:

User registration and login system

Extract and categorize skills using the T5 NLP model

Built with Django, HTML/CSS, and Python
